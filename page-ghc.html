					<strong>Background</strong>:  The Grace Hopper Conference began in 1994.  According to their website, they are the “largest gathering of women technologists.”  It is a multi-day conference held in the fall and covers various topics.  In 2017 over 18,000 people attended the conference in Florida.  One of the ways that this conference sets itself apart from other conferences is how they offer free childcare which helps many people attend this conference who would not have been able to attend otherwise.
