				In this chapter of this book, the authors discuss intersectionality.  They describe how intersectionality can be used as a tool to study problems.  They describe "power plays" and the domains of power "interpersonal, disciplinary, cultural, and structural"(Collins & Bilge, 2016 p. 7).

        This book discusses women in STEM.  The book covers many of the topics that I have found that are part of the situation involving women working in technology.  They address some of the reasons why the representation levels of women are low.  The book covers a topic I have rarely seen covered when addressing this issue and that is the aspect of social capital.

        This writing discusses the history of women in the workforce in America dating back to between 1600 and 1700.  They begin with the various cultures that came to America from other countries but also address Native American women.  They describe how industries that started out as primarily feminine industries became men's work.

        The authors of this book discuss how gender is learned as well as the biology of gender.  They go on to show how certain traits are learned based on which gender the individual is.  These traits are expected to be presented by those in that gender.  They also discuss the value levels that are associated with these traits.

        This video is by female engineer Debbie Sterling.  She discusses how she feels she doesn't fit into the "boys club" of the engineer.  She explains how she was raised by the stereotype of girls.  She wanted to be pretty, not smart.  Sterling gives a first-hand experience about how she experienced the shift from how she was raised to how she became an engineer.  She found that she was at a disadvantage playing with princess toys in that she was unable to develop spacial skills.
