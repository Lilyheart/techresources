        This book on Ada Lovelace is an excellent introduction to the life of one of the original pioneers of technology (p. 5).  Covered is from the circumstances of her unusual parentage to her contributions towards the original digital programmable computer.  Her work was theoretical as the machine was not actually built during her lifetime.  Even so, she is sometimes credited as the first programmer (p. 61).  The first published computer program is credited to her.  The book is highly accessible to readers outside of the computer science spheres as it approaches the topic with reader-friendly terms and breaks down advanced concepts.

        This BBC documentary walks through the history of Ada Lovelace life.  Shown is the machine her contributions help bring into existence.  Through many interviews with various experts, the impact that Ada Lovelace made in the arena of computing is explained.  The partnership between Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage is explored.  Also explained is how the Jacquard loom influenced the work that Babbage and Lovelace accomplished.  This documentary, while nearly an hour long, is an excellent resource as well as entertainment as it does a good job of holding the attention of the viewer by showing the inner workings of various machines instead of simply lecturing about them.
