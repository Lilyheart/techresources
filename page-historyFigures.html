      <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>

          This book on Ada Lovelace is an excellent introduction to the life of one of the original pioneers of technology (p. 5).  Covered is from the circumstances of her unusual parentage to her contributions towards the original digital programmable computer.  Her work was theoretical as the machine was not actually built during her lifetime.  Even so, she is sometimes credited as the first programmer (p. 61).  The first published computer program is credited to her.  The book is highly accessible to readers outside of the computer science spheres as it approaches the topic with reader-friendly terms and breaks down advanced concepts.

	        This short, easily accessible book provides information about Ada Lovelace who was the first computer programmer.  She wrote the very first published computer program.  She wrote this program while the machine it was programmed for was still just an idea and hadn't been made yet.  The book explains how Ada's mother took the unusual path of having her daughter taught math and logic: realms not usually taught to women.

          This BBC documentary walks through the history of Ada Lovelace life.  Shown is the machine her contributions help bring into existence.  Through many interviews with various experts, the impact that Ada Lovelace made in the arena of computing is explained.  The partnership between Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage is explored.  Also explained is how the Jacquard loom influenced the work that Babbage and Lovelace accomplished.  This documentary, while nearly an hour long, is an excellent resource as well as entertainment as it does a good job of holding the attention of the viewer by showing the inner workings of various machines instead of simply lecturing about them.

          In this interview with Grace Hopper by David Letterman, the viewer gains a short background on Grace Hopper and can gain an appreciation for how she made her mark in the field of computing.  At the time of the interview, Grace Hopper was a Rear Admiral (lower half) in the Navy.  She gives an excellent demonstration about regarding the time it takes for satellite communications to travel.  Even though this interview is over thirty years old, this demonstration is still relevant, regardless of changes in technology.

          This book covers Admiral Hopperâ€™s life from her childhood, education, both as a student and a teacher, all the way through her various positions with the Navy.  Covered are the impacts she had in designing and defining both computers and the languages that they use.  Included in the discussion are many of the skills she had which made her so successful such as her abilities to communicate the same message at various levels through her ability to switching vocabulary.  Anyone, especially women, attempting to succeed in roles currently thought of as male roles, would benefit from reading how Admiral Hopper succeed.
