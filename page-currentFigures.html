			<h2>Lyndsey Scott</h2>
				<p class="citation">
          Young, S. (2018, September 11). Victoria’s secret model hits back at trolls for questioning her ability to code. Retrieved from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/victorias-secret-lyndsey-scott-ios-apple-instagram-model-a8532451.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/victorias-secret-lyndsey-scott-ios-apple-instagram-model-a8532451.html</a>

          Lyndsey Scott is a software developer creating code for iOS (the operating system that runs on many of the smaller Apple devices such as the iPhone).  She is a programmer who also has to deal with the intersectionality of gender, race, and beauty.  While she is a software engineer, she is also a Victoria’s Secret model.  The fact that she is a model has caused people to question her ability to program past the beginner levels.  As stated in the article, a doubter posted on an Instagram picture “Anyone can write code, not many people can write code well though. Languages are easy to learn, but scalable, readable, maintainable, efficient code is not.”  Her abilities were questioned solely due to the Instagram image of her. The article goes on to detail how she responded to the criticism.

          Moore, O. (2012, July 11). Woman's call to end video game misogyny sparks vicious online attacks.

          Anita Sarkeesian experienced a litany of abuse after her attempts to show the world how much misogyny existing in gaming culture.  She has been the target of death threats as well as games created about her that allowed the user to digitally attack an image of her until she was bruised and bloody.  The article goes on to explain how even those attempting to defend Anita Sarkeesian then, they themselves, became the target of the attacks.
